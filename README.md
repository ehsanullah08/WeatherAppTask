# Android MVVM Architecture Sample (ViewModel + LiveData + Repository + DI + DataBinding + ViewBinding + Coroutines + Kotlin + Retrofit ) - Weather App

### App features
1. Fetching current location
2. Getting weather information on current location from Openweathermap API
3. User can search any city, country or zipcode to get weather updates
4. User can pull to refresh the weather information


### Libraries used in project

# Kodein: I have used Kodein library to implement Dependency Injection because it's simple to use as compared to dagger or hilt

# LiveData: For communication between data and UI

# DataBinding: To bind data with views directly in xml

# ViewBinding: To reduce boiler plate code of binding resources and prevent null resources exceptions

# Retrofit: To make network calls

# Coroutines: To make Asynchronus network calls

# Repository: To make code more decoupled while communicating between data and business logic layer




### Note: I have used UI from https://github.com/hasancse91 and then updated it according to the requirements because of lack of time. Other than this, I have writen all code by myself.
